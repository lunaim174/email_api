# email_api

This was a really fun project to do! My experience with Python has been short, and learning about Docker was a total new experience! I liked the concept and the different applications of it. I created a class for storage and tried to make the display as pretty as I could with the small time for studying/learning/coding but I think the output is really good! 

Running a Flask environment executes the app in the browser: python -m flask run

Thank you again for the opportunity to present this test and I hope to hear back from you soon! I know I can be a lot better with the right guidance from the ones that already know these tools.

Have a great week!
Irida.
